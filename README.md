# planning-with-code
A Python-powered engine that automates the planning of fashion collections using rule-based distributions and business logic. Built to bridge creative design with data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a rule-based planning engine for fashion assortments. It utilizes Python to automate the distribution of silhouettes, colors, surface design, and details across a 35-product collection, inspired by quiet luxury brands such as Loro Piana and The Row.

The engine integrates:
- **Weighted probability distributions** for color, silhouette, surface, and detail assignments.
- **Business rule validation** (e.g., "No shirt dresses for men", "Sailor collars only on tops").
- **Output generation** for collection plans and validation reports.
- **Power BI visualization** for result analysis and presentation.

## Objectives

- Translate creative strategy into automated rule-based planning.
- Demonstrate integration of Python, Excel, and Power BI in a fashion context.
- Provide a scalable framework for assortment planning that balances creativity and constraints.

## Tech Stack  

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, random  
- **Excel**: initial dataset preparation  
- **Power BI**: final dashboards  
- **GitHub**: version control and portfolio sharing  

## Sample Workflow  

1. **Trend Research**: Imagetic research that served as the base for the Rule Definition
2. **Assortment Strategy Research**: Analyze previous collections from inspiration brands (The Row, Loro Piana)  
3. **Rule Definition**: Set gender ratios, silhouette priorities, and color palettes  
4. **Engine Execution**: Python scripts generate the collection plan automatically  
5. **Visualization**: Power BI dashboards validate results visually  

## Results & Insights  

- Automated the **assortment balancing** process  
- Ensured **design diversity** while respecting constraints  
- Created a **scalable framework** adaptable to different brands and seasons  

## Portfolio & Documentation
