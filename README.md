# planning-with-code
A Python-powered engine that automates the planning of fashion collections using rule-based distributions and business logic. Built to bridge creative design with data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview
This project simulates a rule-based planning engine for fashion assortments. It utilizes Python to automate the distribution of silhouettes, colors, surface design, and details across a 35-product collection, inspired by quiet luxury brands such as Loro Piana and The Row.

The engine integrates:
- **Weighted probability distributions** for color, silhouette, surface, and detail assignments.
- **Business rule validation** (e.g., "No shirt dresses for men", "Sailor collars only on tops").
- **Output generation** for collection plans and validation reports.
- **Power BI visualization** for result analysis and presentation.

## Objectives
- Translate creative strategy into automated rule-based planning.
- Demonstrate integration of Python, Excel, and Power BI in a fashion context.
- Provide a scalable framework for assortment planning that balances creativity and constraints.

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**: pandas, collections, random, custom algorithms
- **Data Structures**: Weighted probability distributions, constraint satisfaction systems
- **Excel**: initial dataset preparation  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards for visual analysis

## Sample Workflow  

1. **Trend Research**: Imagery research serving as the foundation for rule definition and aesthetic direction
2. **Assortment Strategy Research**: Analysis of previous collections from inspiration brands (The Row, Loro Piana) to establish benchmarks
3. **Rule Definition**: Gender ratios, silhouette priorities, design constraints, and color palette development
4. **Engine Execution**: Python scripts automatically generate optimized collection plans while respecting all business rules
5. **Visualization**: Power BI dashboards provide visual validation and strategic insights

## Key Features 
- Strategic Distribution: 65% Feminine / 35% Masculine split with precise category counts
- Color System: 50% neutrals, 35% core colors, 15% accents with brand-specific palette
- Rule Enforcement: Context-aware constraints prevent illogical design combinations
- Quality Assurance: Automatic validation ensures all design elements are represented
- Visual Analytics: Comprehensive dashboards for strategic review

## Business Value 
- Automated Assortment Balancing: Reduced planning time
- Design Consistency: Ensured brand alignment across all collection elements
- Constraint Management: Automated enforcement of design feasibility rules
- Scalable Framework: Adaptable to different brands, seasons, and market segments
- Data-Driven Creativity: Balanced artistic vision with commercial requirements

## Technical Achievements
- Developed a custom weighted probability algorithm for precise distribution control
- Implemented a multi-layer constraint satisfaction system
- Created self-correcting validation mechanisms
- Integration between Python data generation and Power BI visualization
